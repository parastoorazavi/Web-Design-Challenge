-	The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
- A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

**Comparisons page:** <br>

- The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

**Data page:** <br>
- Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
- The table must be a bootstrap table component.
